Not all problems in life can be solved by machine learning. Sometimes you want
to bake something extremely unhealthy and extremely delicious; and I'm fortunate
to have the free time to pursue these desires. Recently I learned how to make,
but not pronounce, croissants and macarons through lots of trial and error
and some faithful taste testing by my wife and my coworkers.

The croissants were surprisingly time consuming when compared to what I saw on
the great british baking show. Even still, they turned out great and even my
boss who was born and raised in France approved:

Macarons were quite a good deal more difficult and technique driven. There were
so many places where you could go wrong, from splitting the ganache, to over
working the batter that they took a bit of practice to get right. Before
Christmas I brought a bunch of mint-white chocolate macarons into the Forge.AI,
and Ivan was kind enough to take some pictures in exchange for a couple:
