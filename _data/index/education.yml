  descr: PhD in Chemical Physics.

          My PhD work focused on the development of novel methods for the modeling of
          correlated harmonic bath models and the treatment of long-range van der waals
          interactions. During the course of my studies, I wrote high performance code
          in C and Fortran, with wrappers to python where applicable.

          Dissertation available upon request.
